# Mini project Html & Css 

I have successfully completed a task named **"Mini Project"** which involved using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project allowed me to apply my web development skills to create a structured and styled web page.


## HTML Structure Description

- **Container:**
  - Created a main container to hold the content of the web page.

- **Inside the Container:**
  - Added a `div` element to serve as a section or block within the page.
  - Inserted a `p` (paragraph) tag within the `div` to hold textual content or information.

This structure forms the basic building blocks of a web page layout, allowing for organized content and styling opportunities with CSS.
## Responsive Design with Bootstrap
