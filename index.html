    <h1>Mini Project On HTML & CSS:</h1>
    <h3>Read the given instructions given below before doing your project</h3>
    <div class="top1">
        <p> The project for your HTML & CSS will be a “mini-web site.” Choose a topic that interests you: something that excites you, something you want to tell the whole world about. If you don’t care about the subject, your readers won’t either.</p>
        <p> I want you to concentrate on the HTML, not on finding content, so do not choose a topic that requires lots of research. For example, unless are an expert about the subject, a web site about the kings of Sweden will need much time-consuming research. On the other hand a website about your favorite hobby won’t take much research at all.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Here are further requirements for the assignment:</h3>
    <div class="top2">
        <p>Your project must contain a minimum of ten original HTML5 pages (files) that you have written. A single HTML5 file with links to nine pages written by other people is not acceptable. You may not simply link to pages that you have practiced for the HTML & CSS. Your material must all be original.</p>
        <p>Diagram showing links among an index page and other content pages is shown in the Sample linkage diagram.</p>
   
    <div class="img d-flex justify-content-center mb-3 ">
        <img  src="./assets/painting-mountain-lake-with-mountain-background_188544-9126.avif" width="500px" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>You must draw a diagram showing how your HTML pages link together, and the linkage must make sense. For the linkage diagram you can use any online tools to draw or you can make your diagram by hand then scan it or take a digital photo of the diagram and upload it to the GitHub.</p>

       <p> Note: A linkage diagram is not the same as a diagram showing. If you have many pages that are all linked to each other, just draw a line that connects them all and label it with words like “all linked to each other” rather than trying to draw dozens of lines with arrows on them.</p>
    </div>
    <div>    <h3>Implementation of your project:</h3>
    <p>Your project must have a main page, and it must be named index.html.</p>
    <p>You must link to at least two external sites that are related to the content of your site.</p>
    <p>Your HTML pages should not contain any inline styles. </p>
    <p>You may not use the deprecated elements! </p>
    <p>You must have at least one .

    </p>
    <p>You must have at least two <table> tags. At least one of these must be used to present tabular data.
    </p>
    <p>Your pages must have proper open close of HTML tags, in order to verify it Click this link and submit your Netlify URL.</p>
    <p>The <title> elements of your pages must be descriptive. (In other words, you can’t have all your pages saying <title>My Project</title>).</p>
